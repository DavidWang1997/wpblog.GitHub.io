## 5.6 Compute x / y

*Description*:

Given two positive integers, compute their quotient, using only the addition, subtraction, and shifting operators.

*Solution*:

1. Brute-force algorithm

   A brute-force approach is to iteratively subtract y from x until what remains is less than y. The number of such subtractions is exactly the quotient, x/y, and the remainder is the term that's less than y. The time complexity is very high, e.g., when y = 1 and x = 2<sup>31</sup>-1, it will take 2<sup>31</sup>-1 iterations.

2. Heuristically

   Try and get more work done in each iteration. For example, we can compute the largest k such that 2<sup>k</sup>y <= x, subtract 2<sup>kÂ </sup> from x, and add 2<sup>k</sup> to the quotient.

   ```java
   public static long divide(long x, long y){
       long result = 0;
       int power = 32;
       long yPower = y << power;
       while(x >= y){
           while(yPower > x){
               yPower >>>= 1;
               --power;
           }
           result += 1L << power;
           x -= yPower;
       }
   }
   ```

   With each iteration, we process an addition bit. Assuming individual shift and add operations take O(1) time, the time complexity is O(n).
