## 5.4 Find a closest integer with the same weight

*Description*:

 Define the weight of a nonnegative integer x to be the number of bits that are set to 1 in its binary representation.

Write a program which takes as input a nonnegative integer x and returns a number y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their difference, |y-x|, is as small as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or all 1s.

*Solution*:

1. Brute-force algorithm

   It might try all integers x-1, x+1, x-2, x+2....., stopping as soon as we encounter one with the same weight as x. This performs very poorly on some inputs. e.g., x = 2<sup>30</sup>. The power of 2 nearest to 2<sup>30</sup> is 2<sup>29</sup>, which means this method will go through over one billion integers.

2. Heuristically

   Since we must preserve the weight, the bit at index k1 has to be different from the bit in k2, otherwise the flips lead to an integer with different weight. This means the smallest k1 can be is the rightmost bit that's different from the LSB, and k2 must be the very next bit. In summary, the correct approach is to swap the two rightmost consecutive bits that differ.

   ```java
   static final int NUM_UNSIGN_BITS = 63;
   
   public static long closestIntSameBitCount(long x){
       // x is assumed to be non-negative so we know the leading bit is 0.
       // We restrict to our attention to 63 LSBs.
       for(int i = 0; i < NUM_UNSIGN_BITS - 1; i++){
           if(((x >>> i) & 1) != ((x >>> (i+1)) & 1))){
               x ^= (1L << i) | (1L << (i+1));
               return x;
           }
       }
       
       // Throw error if all bits of x are 0 or 1.
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("All bits are 0 or 1");
   }
   ```

   The time complexity is O(n), where n is the integer width.
