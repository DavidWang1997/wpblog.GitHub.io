## 7.8 The look-and-say problem

*Description*:

​		Write a program that takes as input an integer n and returns the nth integer in the look-and say sequence. Return the result as a string.

<1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, ...>

*Solution*:

1. We compute the nth solution by iteratively applying this rule n-1 times. 

   ```java
   public static String lookAndSay(n){
       String prev = "1";
       for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
           StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
           int pos = 0;
           while(pos < prev.length()){
               char cur = prev.charAt(pos);
               int count = 1;
               // Should be careful to constraint the pos — it cannot larger than length
               while(pos + 1 < prev.length() && cur == prev.charAt(++pos)) count++;
               sb.append(count + "" + cur);
           }
           prev = sb.toString();
       }
       return prev;
   }
   ```

2.  We can also make the code more elegant by separate the function.

   ```java
   public static String lookAndSay(n){
       String s = "1";
       for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
           s = nextNumber(s);
       }
       return s;
   }
   
   private static String helper(String s){
       StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
       for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
           char cur = s.charAt(i);
           int count = 1;
           while(i+1 < s.length() && s.charAt(++i) == cur) count++;
           sb.append(count);
           sb.append(cur);
       }
       
       return sb.toString();
   }
   ```

   The precise time complexity is a function of the lengths of the terms, which is extremely hard to analyze. Each successive number can have at most twice as many digits as the previous number — this means the maximum length has length no more than 2<sup>n</sup>. Since there are n iterations and the work in each iteration is proportional to the length of the number computed in the iteration, a simple bound on the time complexity is O(n2<sup>n</sup>).
