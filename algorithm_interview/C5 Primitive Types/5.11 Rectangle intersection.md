## 5.11 Rectangle intersection

*Description*:

​	Write a program which test if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection. If intersection is nonempty, return the rectangle formed by their intersection.

*Solution*:

​	There are many qualitatively different ways in which rectangles can intersect. Hence, a better approach is to focus on the conditions under which can be guaranteed that the two rectangle do not intersect.

```java
public static class Rectangle{
    int x, y, width, height;
    
    public Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height){
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    
    public static Rectangle intersectRectangle(Rectangle r1, Rectangle r2){
        if(!isIntersect(r1, r2)){
            return new Rectangel(0, 0, -1, -1);
        }
        return new Rectangle(Math.max(r1.x, r2.x), Math.max(r1.y, r2.y),
                            Math.min(r1.x + r1.width, r2.x + r2.width)
                             - Math.max(r1.x, r2.x),
                            Math.min(r1.y + r1.height, r2.y + r2.height)
                             - Math.max(r1.y, r2.y));
    }
    
    public static boolean isIntersect(Rectangle r1, rectangle r2){
        return r1.x <= r2.x + r2.width && r1.x + r1.width >= r2.x
            && r1.y <= r2.y + r2.height && r1.y + r1.height >= r2.y;
    }
}
```

The time complexity is O(1), since the number of operations is constant.
