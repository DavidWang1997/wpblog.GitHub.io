## 5.5 Compute x * y without arithmetical operators

*Description*:

Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators you are allowed to use are

- assignment
- the bitwise operators >>, <<, |, &, ~, ^ 
- equality checks and boolean combinations thereof.

*Solution*:

1. Brute-force algorithm

   It would be to perform repeated addition, i.e., initialize the result to 0 and then add x to it y times. The time complexity is very high - as much as O(2<sup>n</sup>), where n is the number of bits in the input, and it still leaves open the problem of adding numbers without the presence of an add instruction.

2. Heuristically

   To multiply x and y, we initialize the result to 0 and iterate the bits of x, adding  2<sup>k</sup>y to the result if the kth bit of x is 1. Since we cannot use add directly, we must implement it, i.e., compute the sum bit-by-bit, and "rippling" the carry along.

   ```java
   public static long multiply(long x, long y){
       long sum = 0;
       while(x != 0) {
           // Examines each bit of x.
           if((x & 1) != 0){
               sum = add(sum, y);
           }
           x >>>= 1;
           y <<= 1;
       }
       return sum;
   }
   
   private static long add(long a, long b){
       long sum = 0, carrin = 0, k = 1, tempA = a, tempB = b;
       
       while(tempA != 0 || tempB != 0){
           long ak = a & k, bk = b & k;
           long carryout = (ak & bk) | (ak & carryin) | (bk & carryin);
           sum |= (ak ^ bk ^ carryin);
           carryin = carryout << 1;
           k <<= 1;
           tempA >>>= 1;
           tempB >>>= 1;
       }
       return sum | carryin;
   }
   ```

   The time complexity is O(n), where n is the width of the operands. Since we do n additions to perform a single multiplication, the total time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
