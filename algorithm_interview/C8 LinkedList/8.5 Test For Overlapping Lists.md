## 8.5 Test for overlapping lists (lists may have cycles)

*Description*:

â€‹		Write a program that takes two singly linked lists, which may have cycles, and determines if there exists a node that is common to both lists.

*Solution*:

1. If one list is cyclic, and the other is not, they cannot overlap, so we are done.

   This leaves us with the case that both lists are cyclic. In this case, if they overlap, the cycles must be identical.

   There are two subcases: the paths to the cycle merge before the cycle, in which case there is a unique first node that is common, or the paths reach the cycle at different nodes on the cycle. 

   ```java
   public static ListNode<Integer> overlappingLists(ListNode<Integer> l1, ListNode<Integer> l2){
       
       // store the start of cycle if any.
       ListNode<Integer> root1 = findCycleHead(l1);
       ListNode<Integer> root2 = findCycleHead(l2);
       
       if(root1 == null && root2 == null){
           // Both lists do not have cycle
           return overlappingNoCycleLists(l1, l2);
       }
       else if(root1 == null || root2 == null){
           // One has cycle, while the other has no cycle.
           return null;
       }
       
       // Both have cycles.
       ListNode<Integer> temp = root2;
       
       do{
           temp = temp.next;
       }while(temp != root1 && temp != root2);
       
       if(temp != root1){
           return null; // Cycles are disjoint.
       }
       
       // l1 and l2 end in the same cycle, locate the overlapping node
       // if they first overlap before cycle starts.
       int stem1Length = distance(l1, root1), stem2Length = distance(l2, root2);
       int count = Math.abs(stem1Length - stem2Length);
       
       if(stem1Length > stem2Length){
           l1 = advanceListByK(count, l1);
       }else{
           l2 = advanceListByK(count, l2);
       }
       
       while(l1 != l2 && l1 != root1 && l2 != root2){
           l1 = l1.next;
           l2 = l2.next;
       }
       
       // If l1 == l2 before reaching root1, it means the overlap first occurs
       // before the cycle starts; othersize, the first overlapping node is not unique
       // so we can return any node on the cycle.
       
       return l1 == l2 ? l1 : root1;
       
   }
   
   // Calculates the distance between a and b.
   private static int distance(ListNode<Integer> a, ListNode<Integer> b){
       int dis = 0;
       while(a != b){
           a = a.next;
           ++dis;
       }
       return dis;
   }
   
   // return the cycle head
   private static ListNode<Integer> findCycleHead(ListNode<Integer> head){
       ListNode<Integer> slow = head, fast = head;
       while(slow != null && fast != null){
           slow = slow.next;
           fast = fast.next.next;
           if(slow == fast){
               slow = head;
               while(slow != fast){
                   slow = slow.next;
                   fast = fast.next;
               }
               return slow;
           }
       }
       return null;
   }
   ```
