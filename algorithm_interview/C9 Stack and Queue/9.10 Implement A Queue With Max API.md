## 9.10 Implement a queue with max API

*Description*:

â€‹		Implement a queue with enqueue, dequeue, and max operations. The max operation returns the maximum element currently stored in the queue.

*Solution*:

1. We consider that use an additional Deque to help implement max operation. We now briefly describe how to update the deque on queue updates. If the queue is dequeued, and if the element just dequeued is at the deque's head, we pop the deque from its head; otherwise the deque remains unchanged. When we add an entry to the queue, we iteratively evict from the deque's tail until the element at the tail is greater than or equal to the entry being equeued, and then add the new entry to the deque's tail.

   ```java
   publci static calss QueueWithMax<T extends Comparable<T>> {
       private Queue<T> entries = new LinkedList<>();
       private Queue<T> candidatesForMax = new LinkedList<>();
       
       public void enqueue(T x){
           entries.add(x);
           while(!candidatesForMax.isEmpty()){
               // Eliminate dominated elements in candidatesForMax
               if(candidatesForMax.getLast().compareTo(x) >= 0) break;
               candidatesForMax.removeLast();
           }
           candidatesForMax.addLast(x);
       }
       
       public T dequeue(){
           if(!entries.isEmpty()){
               T t = entries.remove();
               if(result.equals(candidatesForMax.getFirst())){
                   candidatesForMax.removeFirst();
               }
               return t;
           }
           throw new NoSuchElementException("Called dequeue() on empty queue");
           
       }
       
       public T max(){
           if(!candidatesForMax.isEmpty()){
               return candidatesForMax.getFirst();
           }
           throw new NoSuchElementException("empty queue");
       }
   }
   ```

   Each dequeue operation has time O(1) complexity. A single enqueue operation may entail many ejections from the dequeue. However, the amortized time complexity of n enqueues and dequeues is O(n), since an element can be added and removed from the dequeue no more than once. The max operation is O(1) since it consists of returning the element at the head of the deque.

2. An alternate solution that is often presented is to use reduction. Specially, we know how to slove the stack-with-max problem efficiently and we also know how to efficiently model a queue with two stacks, so we can solve the queue-with-max.

   ```java
   public class QueueWithMax{
       private StackWithMax.Stack enqueue = new StackWithMax.Stack();
       private StackWithMax.Stack dequeue = new StackWithMax.Stack();
       
       public void enqueue(Integer x){ enqueue.push(x);}
       
       public void dequeue(){
           if(enqueue.empty()){
               while(!enqueue.empty()){
                   dequeue.push(enqueue.pop());
               }
           }
           if(!dequeue.empty()){
               return dqueue.pop();
           }
           throw new NoSuchElementException("Cannot get dequeue() on empty queue.");
       }
       
       public Integer max(){
           if(!enqueue.empty()){
               return dequeue.empty()? enqueue.max() : Math.max(enqueue.max(), dequeue.max());
           }
           if(!dequeue.empty()){
               return dequeue.max();
           }
           throw new NoSuchElementException("Cannot get max() on empty queue.");
       }
   }
   ```

   Since the stack-with-max has O(1) amortized time complexity for push, pop and max, and the queue from two stacks has O(1) amortized time complexity for enqueue and dequeue, this approach has O(1) amortized time complexity for enqueue, dequeue, and max.
