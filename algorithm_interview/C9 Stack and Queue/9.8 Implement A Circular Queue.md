## 9.8 Implement a circular queue

*Description*:

â€‹		Implement a queue API  using an array for storing elements. Your API should include a constructor function, which takes as argument the initial capacity of the queue, enqueue and dequeue functions, and a function which returns the number of elements stored. Implement dynamic resizing to support storing an arbitrarily large number of elements.

*Solution*:

1. A better approach is to keep one more variable to track the head. This way, dequeue can also be performed in O(1) time. When performing an enqueue into a full array, we need to resize the array. We cannot only resize, because this results in queue elements not appearing contiguously.

   ```java
   public static class Queue{
       private int head = 0, tail = 0, numQueueElements = 0;
       private static final int SCALE_FACTOR = 2;
       private Integer[] entries;
       
       public Queue(int capacity){
           entirs = new Integer[capacity];
       }
       
       public void enqueue(Integer x){
           if(numQueueElements == entires.length){ // need to resize
               // makes the queue elements appear consecutively.
               Collectioins.rotate(Arrays.asList(entries), -head);
               // Resets head and tail
               head = 0;
               tail = numQueueElements;
               entries = Arrays.copyOf(entries, numQueueElements * SCALE_FACTOR);
           }
           entries[tail] = x;
           tail = (tail + 1) % entries.length;
           ++numQueueElements;
       }
       
       public Integer deque(){
           if(numQueueElements != 0){
               --numQueueElements;
               Integer ret = entries[head];
               head = (head + 1) % entires.length;
               return ret;
           }
           throw new NoSuchElementException("Deque called on an empty queue.");
       }
       
       public int size(){return numQueueElements;}
   }
   ```
