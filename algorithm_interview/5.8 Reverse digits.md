## 5.8 Reverse digits

*Description*:

Write a program which takes an integer and returns the integer corresponding to the digits of the input written in reverse order.

*Solution*:

1. The *brute-force* approach is to convert the input to a String, and then compute the reverse from the string by traversing it from back to front.

   ```java
   public static int reverse(int x){
       char[] c = String.valueOf(x).toCharArray();
       ArrayUtils.reverse(c);
       return Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(c));
   }
   ```



2. Closer analysis shows that we can avoid having to form a string. Consider the input 1132. The first digit of the result is 2, which we can obtain by taking the input modulo 10. The remaining digits of the result are the reverse of 1132/10 = 113. Generalizing, let the input be k. If k >= 0, then k mod 10 is the most significant digit of the result and the subsequent digits are the reverse of k/10.

   For general k, we record its sign, solve the problem for |k|, and apply the sign to the result.

```java
public static long reverse(int x){
    long result = 0;
    boolean sign = (x >= 0)? true : false;
    x = Math.abs(x);
    
    while(x != 0){
        result = result * 10 + x % 10;
        x = x/10;
    }
    
    return sign ? result : -result;
}
```

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of digits in k.
