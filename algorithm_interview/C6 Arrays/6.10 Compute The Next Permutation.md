*Description*:

â€‹		Write a program that takes as input a permutaation, and returns the next permutation on the array  under the dictory  ordering. If the permutation is the last permutation, return the empty array.

*Solution*:

1. A brute-force approach might be to find all permutations whose length equals that of the input array, sort them according to the dictionary order, then find the successor of the input permutation in that ordering. Apart from the enormous space and time complexity this entails, simply computing all permutations of length n is a nontrivial problem.

2. The key insight is that we want to increase the permutation by as little as possible. k

   The general algorithm for computing the next permutation is as follows:

   - Find k such that p[k] < p[k+1] and entries after index k appear in decreasing order.
   - Find the smallest p[l] such thaat p[l] > p[k] (such an l must exist since p[k] < p[k + 1]).
   - Swap p[l] and p[k] (note that the sequence after position k remains in decreasing order).
   - Reverse the sequence after position k.

   ```java
   public static List<Integer> nextPermutation(List<Integer> perm){
       int k = perm.size() - 2;
       while(k >= 0 && perm.get(k) >= perm.get(k + 1)){
           --k;
       }
       if(k == -1) return Collections.emptyList(); // perm is the last permutation
       
       // Swap the smallest entry after index k that is greater than perm[k].
       // We exploit the fact that perm.subList(k + 1, perm.size()) is decreasing
       // So if we search in reverse order, the first entry is greater than perm[k] is the smallest
       
       for(int i = perm.size() - 1; i > k; --i){
           if(perm.get(i) > perm.get(k)){
               Collections.swap(perm, k, i);
               break;
           }
       }
       // The whole for loop can be replaced by Collections.swap(perm, k, perm.size()-1);
       
       // Since perm.subList(k + 1, perm.size()) is in decreasing order, we can build the smallest
       // dictionary ordering of this subarray by reversing it.
       Collections.reverse(perm.subList(k + 1, perm.size()));
       return perm;
   }
   ```

   Each step is an iteration through an array, so the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
