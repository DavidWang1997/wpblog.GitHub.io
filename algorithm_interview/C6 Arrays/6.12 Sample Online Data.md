## 6.12 Sample online data

*Description*:

â€‹		Write a program that takes as input a size k, and reads packets, continuously maintaining a uniform random subset of size k of the read packets.

*Solution*:

1. A brute-force approach would be to store all the packets read so far. After reading in each packet, we apply Solution 6.11 to compute a random subset of k packets. The space complexity is high O(n), and time complexity is O(nk).

2. The formal proof that the algorithm works correctly, uses induction on the number of packets that have been read. Specifically, the induction hypothesis is that all k-sized subsets are equally like after n >= k packets have been read.

   ```java
   // Assumption: there are at least k elements in the stream.
   public static List<Integer> onlineRandomSample
       (Iterator<Integer> sequence, int k){
       List<Integer> runningSample = new ArrayList<>(k);
       // Stores the first k element.
       for(int i = 0; sequence.hasNext() && i < k; ++i){
           runningSample.add(sequence.next());
       }
       
       // Have read the first k elements.
       int numSeenSoFar = k;
       Random randIdxGen = new Random();
       while(sequence.hasNext()){
           Integer x = sequence.next();
           ++numSeenSoFar;
           // Generate a random number in[0, numSeenSoFar], 
           // and if this number is in [0, k - 1], 
           // we replace that element from the sample with x.
           final int idxToReplace = randIdxGen.nextInt(numSeenSoFar);
           if(idxToReplace < k){
               runningSample.set(idxToReplace, x);
           }
       }
       return runningSample;
   }
   ```

   The time complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the stream, since we spend O(1) time per element. The space complexity is O(k);
