## 6.5 Delete duplicates from a sorted array

*Description*:

â€‹		Write a program which takes as input a sorted array and updates it so that all duplicates have been removed and the remaining elements have been shifted left to fill the emptied indices. Return the number of valid elements.

*Solution*:

1. The intuition behind achieving a better time complexity is to reduce the amount of shifting. Since the array is sorted, repeated elements must appear one-after-another, so we do not need an auxiliary data structure to check if an element has appeared already. We move just one element, rather than an entire subarray, and ensure that we move it just once.

   ```java
   public static int deleteDuplicates(List<Integer> list){
       if(list.isEmpty()) reutrn 0;
       int writeIndex = 1;
       for(int i = 1; i < list.size(); ++i){
           if(!list.get(i).equals(list.get(writeIndex - 1))){
               list.set(writeIndex++, list.get(i));
           }
       }
       return writeIndex;
   }
   ```

   

   ```java
   public static int deleteDuplicates(int[] nums){
       if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return nums;
       int pointer = 0;
       for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
           if(nums[i] != nums[pointer]){
               nums[++pointer] = nums[i];
           }
       }
       return pointer;
   }
   ```

   Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
