## 6.4 Advancing through an array

*Description*:

Write a program which takes an array of n integers, where A[i] denotes the maximum you can advance from index i, and returns whether it is possible to advance to the last index starting from the beginning of the array.

*Solution*:

1.  As we iterate through the array, we track the furthest index we know we can advance to. The furthest we can advance from index i is i + A[i]. If, for some i before the end of the array, i is the furthest index that we have demonstrated that we can advance to, we cannot reach the last index. Otherwise, we reach the end.

   ```java
   public static boolean canReachEnd(List<Integer> maxAdvanceSteps){
       int furthestReachSoFar = 0, lastIndex = maxAdvanceSteps.size() - 1;
       for(int i = 0; i <= furthestReachSoFar && furthestReachSoFar < lastIndex; ++i){
           furthestReachSoFar = Math.max(furthestReachSoFar, i + maxAdvanceSteps.get(i));
       }
       return furthestReachSoFar >= lastIndex;
   }
   ```

   The time complexity is O(n), and the additional space complexity is O(1).
