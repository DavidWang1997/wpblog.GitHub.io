## 6.11 Sample offline data

*Description*:

â€‹		Write a program that takes as input an array of distinct elements and a size, and returns a subset of the given size of the array elements. All subsets should be qually likely. Return the result in input array itself.

*Solution*:

1.  Let the input array be A, its length n, and the specified size k. A naive approach is to iterate through the input array, selecting entries with probability k/m. Although the average number of selected entries is k, we may select more or less than k entries in this way.

2. Another approach is to enumerate all subsets of size k and then select one at random from these. Since there are (C<sub>n</sub><sup>k</sup>) subsets of size k, the time and space complexity are huge.

3. The key to efficiently building a random subset of size exactly k is to first build one of size k-1 and then adding one more element, selected randomly from the rest. 

   ```java
   public static void randomSampling(int k, List<Integer> A){
       Random gen = new Random();
       for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
           // Generate a random int in [i, A.size() - i]
           Collections.swap(A, i, i + gen.nextInt(A-size() - i));
       }
   }
   ```

   The algorithm clearly runs in additional O(1) space. The time complexity is O(k) to select the elements.

   *Note that the algorithm makes k calls to the random number generator. When k is bigger than n/2, we can optimize by computing a subset of n-k elements to remove from the set.*
