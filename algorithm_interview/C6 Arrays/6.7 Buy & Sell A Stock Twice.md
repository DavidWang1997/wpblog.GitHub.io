## 6.7 Buy and sell a stock twice

*Description*:

​		Write a program that computes the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a share at most twice. The second buy must be made on another date after the first sale.

*Solution*:

1. The brute-force algorithm which examines all possible combinations of buy-sell-buy-sell days have complexity O(n<sup>4</sup>). The complexity can be improved to O(n<sup>2</sup>) by applying the O(n) algoithm to each pair of subarrays formed by splitting list.

   ​	Suppose we record the best solution for A[0 : j], j between 1 and n - 1, inclusive. Now we can do a reverse iteration, computing the best solution for a single buy-and-sell for A[J : n-1], j between 1 and n-1, inclusive. For each day, we combine this result with the result from the forward iteration for the previous day—this yields the maximum profit if we buy and sell once before the current day and once at or after the current day.

   ```java
   public static double buyAndSellStockTwice(List<Double> prices){
       double maxTotalProfit = 0.0;
       List<Double> firstBuySellProfits = new ArrayList<>();
       double minPriceSoFar = Double.MAX_VALUE;
       
       // Forward phase. For each day, we record maximum profit if we sell on that day
       for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++){
           minPriceSoFar = Math.min(minPriceSoFar, prices.get(i));
           maxTotalProfit = Math.max(maxTotalProfit, prices.get(i) - minPriceSoFar);
           firstBuySellProfits.add(maxTotalProfit);
       }
       
       // Backward phase. 
       // For each day, find the maximum profit if we make the second buy on that day
       double maxPriceSoFar = Double.MIN_VALUE;
       for(int i = price.size() - 1; i > 0; i--){
           maxPriceSoFar = Math.max(maxPriceSoFar, prices.get(i));
           maxTotalProfit = Math.max(maxTotalProfit, maxPriceSoFar - prices.get(i) + 							 firstBuySellProfits.get(i-1));
       }
       return maxTotalProfit;
   }
   ```

   The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), whcih is the space used to store the best solutions for the subarrays.
