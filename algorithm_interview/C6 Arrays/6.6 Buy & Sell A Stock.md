## 6.6 Buy and sell a stock once

*Description*:

â€‹		Write a program that takes an array denoting the daily stock price, and returns the maximum profit that could be made by buying and then selling one share of that stock.

*Solution*:

1. Compute the maximum profit by computing the difference of the current entry with the minimum value seen so far as we iterate through the array.

   ```java
   public static double computeMaxProfit(List<Double> prices){
       double minPrice = Double.MAX_VALUE, maxProfit = 0.0;
       
       for(Double price : prices){
           maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
           minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
       }
       return maxProfit;
   }
   ```

   The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), where n is the length of the array.
