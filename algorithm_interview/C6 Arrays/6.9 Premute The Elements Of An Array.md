## 6.9 Permute the elements of an array

*Description*:

​		Given an array A of n elements and a permutation P, apply P to A.

​		For example, the permutation <2,0,1,3> applied to A = <a,b,c,d> yeilds the array <b,c,a,d>.

*Solution*:

1. It is simple to apply a permutation-array to a given array if additional storage is available to write the resulting array. We allocate a new array B of the same length, set B[P[i]] = A[i] for each i, and then copy B to A. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).

2. A key insight to improving space complexity is to decompose permutations into simpler structures which can be processed incrementally.  Every permutation can be represented by a collection of independent permutations, each of which is cyclic, that is, it moves all elements by a fixed offset, wrapping around.

   ```java
   public static void applyPermutation(List<Integer> perm, List<Integer> A){
       for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); ++i){
           // Check if the element at index i has not been moved by checking 
           // if perm.get(i) is nonnegative
           int next = i;
           while(perm.get(next) >= 0){
               Collections.swqp(A, i, perm.get(next));
               int temp = perm.get(next);
               // Subtracts perm.size() from an entry in perm to make it negative.
               // which indicates the corresponding move has been performed.
               perm.set(next, perm.get(next) - perm.size());
               next = temp;
           }
       }
       
       // Restore perm
       for(int i = 0; i < perm.size(); i++){
           perm.set(i, perm.get(i) + perm.size());
       }
   }
   ```

   The program above will apply the permutation in O(n) time and space complexity is O(1).
